    "text": "Intro\nThis is a walkthrough on webscraping Google Scholar using SerpApi. This guide will show how to obtain a free API key allowing you to gather author publications and other information from Google Scholar. We’ll also go over how to securely store the API key in a .env file and how to access the key from the .env file.\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\nNavigate to the SerpApi website and register for a free account. You can sign in using your email or GitHub. After you register and confirm your email address, you will receive a secret key located towards the bottom of the screen.\n\n\n\nSerpApi key\n\n\nCreate a .env file in your project repo. You’ll want to immediately add that to your .gitignore file before you even commit the .env file to your repo. You do not want to make the mistake of scripting your secret key into your files or forget to do it later. In the .env file, add the following line:\n# my google scholar api key\nGOOGLE_KEY=\"&lt;your_secret_key_provided_when_you_registered&gt;\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nEnd your .env file with a newline. This will save you a minor warning later on.\n\n\nNow you should save the file and commit it to your project repo.\n\n** Stay tuned… coming back with more! **"
