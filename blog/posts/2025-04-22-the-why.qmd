> This is multipart series where I elaborate on the details of configuring my homelab. 
I've installed Ubuntu 25.04 ("Plucky Puffin") as the operating system on my Lenovo laptop 
and am running Debian 12 ("bookworm") on my main 8GB Raspberry Pi 5. The Pi is the host 
device for the other services listed throughout this series.

Steps not covered: 

* Installing Linux on your machine
* Initial configuration a Raspberry Pi
* Basics of SSH to remotely access devices on your home network

## Purpose of my Home Lab

The origin of this project is hopefully relatable to you, the reader: I just wanted to see
if I could just do it. This question though was: am I capable of deploying self-hosted 
services on my home network, and then safely & securely access
them from outside the home?

Networking? Never heard of her, well not insofar as an academic data analyst.
Our team tends to operate more in GitHub collaborative projects (thus my 
potential over-posting of GitHub things [here](2024-05-22-beginner-git-team-workflow.qmd),
[here](2025-04-14-github-actions-email.qmd) and especially [here](2025-04-17-github-teams.qmd)).
I just wanted to geek out, `rsync` my [Timeshift](https://teejee2008.github.io/timeshift/)
backups and other files off my laptop to another device, and feel like one of the cool
tech kids.

:::{.callout-important title="UPDATE:"}
I'm still not a cool kid, but got this working so there you go!
:::

The main goals I established before undertaking this project were: 

* Learn to remotely access devices on my home network
* Share files across devices
* Set-up a Raspberry Pi for self-hosted services
* Learn "WTH is Docker and how do I use it?"
* **Make it so that only *I* can access these on a secure connection!** No connection, no access.
* Test how much I can de-Google & de-Apple my life

The last part involved needing to find ways to self-host document & file management and
photos. The cost of using cloud storage isn't all that intrusive, but it does add up over
time. One major hurdle would be leaving the comfort of known apps and have it all fitting
easily into daily life.

Happily, with help from [`r/selfhosted`](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/) 
and some feedback from YouTube, I've been able to tweak things just enough to 
make it work for me. I should have stated this towards the top, but I've made plenty of 
mistakes and had a few moments of "oh $h!t... did I just brick my system, lose my data, 
erase *x, y, & z*??" but...

Live, laugh, and backup all your important things first!
