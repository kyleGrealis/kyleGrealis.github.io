## Using a collaborative git workflow

When collaborating as a team (or even when creating and using personal data science project), these steps can help avoid potential conflicts and other issues that can arise while using `git`. Please keep in mind that this list isn't expansive nor does it get into nuanced details. Those more serious bits I'll leave for instructionals that are better suited to handle complicated matters. What this post is, though, is a starter guide with bits of anecdotal suggestions that I hope can keep you focused on the task at hand: being an awesome data scientist!

1. **Navigate to your project** in the IDE of your choice (RStudio, Posit Cloud, etc.)

2. **Check that you are on the `main` branch** by inspecting the viewer window in RStudio or typing `git branch` into the terminal. For peace of mind, and to save complexity, the remainder of this post will not be referencing terminal commands. To learn more, see the [git documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs){target='_blank'} for fantastic instructions.

3. **`Pull` from the repository into the `main` branch.** This ensures that you have the latest updates to the main version of the project. Sometimes you may not have been informed of changes added to `main` since your last time using the project. `Pull`ing into `main` at the start and before working on anything can help avoid issues.

4. **_IF_ you are creating a new feature, make a new branch.** For example, if I were to create a new script to clean a dataset, I could create a new branch named `data-clean-kg` to tell other members what I'm doing with my initials. It's a convention I use, but adopt your own. Keep in mind that it's best to make a branch for one feature, work on that feature, then continue these steps. It's not always recommended to make a branch and work on multiple aspects of the project on the same branch. *Remember*, these are suggetions and not hard-and-fast rules.

5. **One feature per branch.** This deserves its own line. Again, a feature doesn't mean one scripting file. A feature is a new or edited aspect of the current project. Sometimes a new file must be `source`d into another, so you can't help but rendering changes to more than one piece of the overall project. What I'm referring to is this: in BST692 at the University of Miami, you'll be constructing many different types of machine learning models... don't write your logistic model on the same branch as your LASSO and KNN and random forest. Make sense? Instead make a branch `lasso-kg` or `knn-kg` or `get-logistic-metrics-kg`.

6. **`stage` & `commit` your changes and add a short but descriptive message.** I tend to write commit messages like these: `initial commit: data cleaning script` or `edit: added new dataset and joined with original`. Short and descriptive messages are helpful and your future self (or team members) will thank you if the project needs to roll back to a working state. Things break, mistakes happen, but documenting along the way will quickly get your project up and running again. So, write some code, `stage` and `commit` with a message, and get into the [zen coding flow state](https://www.evozon.com/coding-and-the-flow-state/){target='_blank'}.

7. **`push` your commit to the project repository.** Get into the habit of pushing your commits from your branch to the project repository. This will not add them to the `main` branch if you are working on a remote branch... as you should be if you completed Step 4. Do this before lunch, do it before that meeting, do it while you find your brain drift away from what you're working on, but **do it before you leave the office for the day!** The beauty of using a tool like GitHub is that I'll be upset if brick my computer and lose my hard drive, but not as upset if my months-long machine learning project can be restored onto another machine from the cloud.

8. **Open a pull request** in GitHub and add team members to review. Those reviewers will see your changes, have the ability to approve or add comments or both, and provide constructive feedback. This is done openly so others can see what's happening within the project. For example, I request reviews from the main authors when working on the [rUM](https://raymondbalise.github.io/rUM/){target='_blank'} and we provide feedback if a new edit or feature is good, needs improvement, or is a bad idea. Finally, when another collaborator approves...

9. **YOU MADE THE BRANCH, YOU MERGE THE CHANGES & DELETE THE BRANCH!** You should not merge change that you didn't make and you definitely should not delete a branch you did not create. This is very important for collaborative workflows. I've had my proverbial hand'slapped for approving a pull request, merging it into the main project, and deleting the branch... all from someone else's work. This should always be regarded as a big "No, don't do it!!!" The *feature or branch's author* should be the only one to literally push the buttons to merge (again, once approved) and delete the branch.

I hope this little guide was helpful and provides insight on how to work as a team. I'm a beginner and always find ways to improve my workflow. I tend to test things on my own before doing them in the collaborative setting. Working with other people affords the opportunity to communicate effectively and efficiently. Use those same concepts when working with git: write commit messages that aren't `update done` and rather `edit: added forest plot for subset predictors`. Lastly, this post will probably be updated as I find better ways. If you have some, please share: [kylegrealis@icloud.com](mailto:kylegrealis@icloud.com)
