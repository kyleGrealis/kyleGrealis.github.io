> This is multipart series where I elaborate on the details of configuring my homelab. 
I've installed Ubuntu 25.04 ("Plucky Puffin") as the operating system on my Lenovo laptop 
and am running Debian 12 ("bookworm") on my main 8GB Raspberry Pi 5. The Pi is the host 
device for the other services listed throughout this series.

Go check out [The "Why?"](2025-04-22-the-why.qmd) to understand my intention of this

## Automatic Tailscale Exit Node Management Based on Wi-Fi Networks

This documentation explains how to set up automatic switching of 
[Tailscale exit node](https://tailscale.com/kb/1103/exit-nodes) 
configurations based on which Wi-Fi network you're connected to. On untrusted public 
networks (coffee shops, airports, hotels), routing all traffic through your secure exit 
node creates an encrypted tunnel that prevents local eavesdropping and protects your data 
from potential attackers on the same network. However, this protection comes with 
trade-offs - all traffic must travel to your exit node first before reaching its 
destination, which can increase latency and effectively double your data's journey 
across the internet. On trusted home networks where security concerns are minimal, 
disabling exit node routing allows for direct internet access with lower latency and 
better performance for bandwidth-intensive applications. This automation solution gives 
you the best of both worlds: automatic protection when you need it and direct connections 
when you don't, without requiring manual intervention every time you change networks.

## Overview

When connecting to different Wi-Fi networks, you may want different Tailscale behaviors:

- On trusted home networks: Disable Tailscale exit node (direct internet access)
- On untrusted networks: Enable Tailscale exit node (route all traffic through your secure server)

This solution uses NetworkManager's dispatcher scripts to automatically detect network 
changes and apply the appropriate Tailscale configuration.

:::{.callout-note title="Linux-tested"}
The solution I've described is specifically designed for Linux systems using 
NetworkManager, so it won't work directly on macOS or Windows without significant 
modifications. The core concept (detecting network changes and toggling Tailscale settings) 
is transferable, but the implementation details, commands, and file locations would be 
completely different on each operating system. Each would require its own platform-specific 
implementation of the same idea.
:::

## Component 1: Tailscale Home Script

The first component is a script that disables Tailscale exit node routing when on trusted 
networks (i.e., home):

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# tailscale-home.sh - Disable exit node routing
# Usage: ./tailscale-home.sh

echo "Disabling Tailscale exit node protection..."
sudo tailscale up --exit-node=""

# Verify the change
STATUS=$(tailscale status)

if echo $STATUS | grep -q "offers exit node"; then
    echo "✅ Exit node protection disabled! Traffic now routes normally."
else
    echo "❌ Something went wrong. Please check tailscale status."
fi
```

This script:
1. Runs the Tailscale command to disable exit node routing (`--exit-node=""`)
2. Checks if the change was successful
3. Provides feedback on the operation's success

## Component 2: Tailscale Protect Script

The second component enables the exit node when on untrusted networks (i.e., coffee shop,
hotel, public Wi-Fi).:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# tailscale-protect.sh - Route all traffic through Pi5 exit node
# Usage: ./tailscale-protect.sh

# Set the HOST_IP to match your exit node's Tailscale IP
HOST_IP="100.xxx.xxx.xxx"

echo "Enabling Tailscale exit node protection..."
sudo tailscale up --exit-node=$HOST_IP

# Verify the change
STATUS=$(tailscale status)

if echo $STATUS | grep -q "; exit node;"; then
    echo "✅ Exit node protection enabled! All traffic now routes through your Tailnet."
else
    echo "❌ Something went wrong. Please check tailscale status."
fi
```

This script:
1. Sets the exit node to your host's Tailscale IP address
2. Verifies the change was successful
3. Provides feedback on the operation's success

## Component 3: NetworkManager Dispatcher Script

The third component is a NetworkManager dispatcher script that automatically runs the 
appropriate script based on which network you're connected to. A log is created and saved, 
and you can watch it update in [real time](#testing). I was able to test this by 
alternating between my home's "Go_Canes" secure Wi-Fi and a mobile hotspot. Just be sure 
to update the `KNOWN_NETS` line below specific to your case:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Save this as /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/99-tailscale-autoswitch

# Make sure we have the required permissions
if [ "$(id -u)" != "0" ]; then
   echo "This script must be run as root" 
   exit 1
fi

INTERFACE=$1
STATUS=$2

# Define known networks as array: Change listed names as appropriate
KNOWN_NETS=("Go_Canes" "Canes_guest")
HOME_SCRIPT="$HOME/tailscale-home.sh"
PROTECT_SCRIPT="$HOME/tailscale-protect.sh"
LOG_FILE="/var/log/tailscale-autoswitch.log"

log() {
    echo "$(date): $*" >> "$LOG_FILE"
}

log "Network change detected: Interface=$INTERFACE Status=$STATUS"

# Dynamically detect WiFi interface name
WIFI_INTERFACE=$(nmcli -t -f DEVICE,TYPE device | grep ":wifi$" | cut -d: -f1)

# Only act on wifi connections that are activated
if [ "$STATUS" = "up" ] && [ "$INTERFACE" = "$WIFI_INTERFACE" ]; then
    # Get the current SSID
    CURRENT_SSID=$(nmcli -t -f active,ssid dev wifi | grep '^yes' | cut -d: -f2)
    log "Connected to SSID: $CURRENT_SSID"

    # Initialize a flag to check if the network is known
    KNOWN=false

    for NETWORK in "${KNOWN_NETS[@]}"; do
        if [ "$CURRENT_SSID" = "$NETWORK" ]; then
            KNOWN=true
            break
        fi
    done

    if [ "$KNOWN" = true ]; then
        log "Home network detected: $CURRENT_SSID. Running home script..."
        bash "$HOME_SCRIPT" >> "$LOG_FILE" 2>&1
    else
        log "Unknown network detected: $CURRENT_SSID! Running protect script..."
        bash "$PROTECT_SCRIPT" >> "$LOG_FILE" 2>&1
    fi
fi

exit 0
```

### How the Dispatcher Script Works

1. **Permissions Check**: Makes sure the script runs as root
2. **Network Detection**: Takes network interface and status from NetworkManager
3. **Known Networks List**: Maintains an array of trusted Wi-Fi SSIDs
4. **Logging Function**: Creates a detailed log of all operations
5. **Dynamic Interface Detection**: Automatically finds the WiFi interface name rather than hardcoding it
6. **Interface Filtering**: Only processes WiFi connections that are coming up
7. **SSID Extraction**: Gets the SSID of the currently connected network
8. **Network Verification**: Checks if the current network is in the trusted list
9. **Script Execution**: Runs either the home script or protect script based on network trust
10. **Logging Results**: Records the entire process for troubleshooting

## Installation Steps

1. Create the home and protect scripts:
   ```bash
   nano ~/tailscale-home.sh
   nano ~/tailscale-protect.sh
   ```

2. Make them executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x ~/tailscale-home.sh
   chmod +x ~/tailscale-protect.sh
   ```

3. Create the NetworkManager dispatcher script:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/99-tailscale-autoswitch
   ```

4. Make the dispatcher script executable:
   ```bash
   sudo chmod +x /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/99-tailscale-autoswitch
   ```

5. Create a log file:
   ```bash
   sudo touch /var/log/tailscale-autoswitch.log
   sudo chmod 666 /var/log/tailscale-autoswitch.log
   ```

## Testing and Monitoring {#testing}

You can monitor the script's operation by viewing the log file:

```bash
tail -f /var/log/tailscale-autoswitch.log
```

Example log output showing automatic switching between networks:

```
Mon Apr 21 22:58:43 CDT 2025: Network change detected: Interface=wlp0s20f3 Status=up
Mon Apr 21 22:58:43 CDT 2025: Connected to SSID: Go_Canes
Mon Apr 21 22:58:43 CDT 2025: Home network detected: Go_Canes. Running home script...
Disabling Tailscale exit node protection...
✅ Exit node protection disabled! Traffic now routes normally.

Mon Apr 21 23:03:34 CDT 2025: Network change detected: Interface=wlp0s20f3 Status=up
Mon Apr 21 23:03:34 CDT 2025: Connected to SSID: Alexa?s iPhone
Mon Apr 21 23:03:34 CDT 2025: Unknown network detected: Alexa?s iPhone! Running protect script...
Enabling Tailscale exit node protection...
✅ Exit node protection enabled! All traffic now routes through your Tailnet.

Mon Apr 21 23:04:00 CDT 2025: Network change detected: Interface=wlp0s20f3 Status=up
Mon Apr 21 23:04:00 CDT 2025: Connected to SSID: Go_Canes
Mon Apr 21 23:04:00 CDT 2025: Home network detected: Go_Canes. Running home script...
Disabling Tailscale exit node protection...
✅ Exit node protection disabled! Traffic now routes normally.
```

The log shows:

- Network changes detected
- Which SSID you're connecting to
- Whether the network is trusted or untrusted
- Which script was executed
- The result of the operation

## Customization

1. **Add More Trusted Networks**:
   Modify the `KNOWN_NETS` array to include additional trusted networks:
   ```bash
   KNOWN_NETS=("Go_Canes" "Canes_guest" "Work_WiFi" "Parents_Home")
   ```

2. **Log Rotation**:
   To prevent the log file from growing too large:
   ```bash
   # Add near the top of the script
   if [ -f "$LOG_FILE" ] && [ $(stat -c%s "$LOG_FILE") -gt 1048576 ]; then
       mv "$LOG_FILE" "$LOG_FILE.old"
   fi
   ```

3. **Exit Node Connectivity Check**:
   Add to the protect script to check if your exit node is online:
   ```bash
   # Add to tailscale-protect.sh before enabling the exit node
   ping -c 1 $PI5_IP > /dev/null 2>&1
   if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
       echo "⚠️ Warning: Exit node appears to be offline!"
   fi
   ```

4. **Modify Log Location**:
   Change the `LOG_FILE` variable to use a different log file location.

## Understanding NetworkManager Events

NetworkManager triggers multiple events during a network connection:

1. Network down event
2. DHCP4 configuration (IPv4)
3. Interface up event (this is when our script runs)
4. DNS configuration
5. DHCP6 configuration (IPv6)

Our script specifically targets the "up" event to ensure the network is ready before 
applying Tailscale configurations.

## Why Dynamic Interface Detection Matters

The script uses dynamic interface detection instead of hardcoding the WiFi interface name. 
This future-proofs your setup because WiFi interface names can change when:

- You replace or add network hardware
- You upgrade your kernel or distribution
- Your system's PCI enumeration changes
- You connect an additional WiFi adapter (like a USB dongle)

By detecting the interface dynamically, the script will continue working even if these 
changes occur.

## Troubleshooting

If the script isn't working as expected:

1. Check the log file for errors:
   ```bash
   tail -f /var/log/tailscale-autoswitch.log
   ```

2. Verify the script is executable:
   ```bash
   ls -l /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/99-tailscale-autoswitch
   ```

3. Test the scripts manually:
   ```bash
   sudo bash $HOME/tailscale-home.sh
   sudo bash $HOME/tailscale-protect.sh
   ```

4. Check your current WiFi interface name:
   ```bash
   nmcli device status | grep wifi
   ```

5. Test interface detection:
   ```bash
   nmcli -t -f DEVICE,TYPE device | grep ":wifi$" | cut -d: -f1
   ```
