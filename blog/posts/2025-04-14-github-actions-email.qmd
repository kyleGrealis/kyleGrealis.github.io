## Purpose

Using automation with GitHub Actions is a great way to simplify project updates. This 
example will demonstrate how to connect an iCloud account to your repository and receive 
automated emails after a workflow job has completed.

---

## Requirements

1. GitHub repository
2. iCloud email account
3. Enabling an app-specific password in iCloud
4. A GitHub actions workflow file

---

## Steps

> While this demonstration uses iCloud, adapting Ravgeet Dhillon’s 
[blog post](https://www.ravsam.in/blog/send-email-notification-when-github-action-fails/){target="_blank"} 
to suit your needs should be fairly easy.


### Part 1: iCloud

1. Login to your iCloud account and navigate to your icon in the upper right of the 
screen. Select “Manage Apple Account” from the list of options:

2. Proceed to login and complete the two-factor authorization, if enabled.

3. Select “App-Specific Passwords” from the tile options.

4. Select the plus symbol (`+`).

5. Add a name for your passowrd.

6. Complete the verification.

7. **Save and copy** this password immediately! You cannot recover or see it again once you select "Done".

### Part 2: GitHub

1. Navigate to the repository where you will be adding the GitHub Action. From the top 
bar, select “Settings”. On the left side, select “Secrets and variables” then “Actions”.

2. Follow this format. Store the iCloud app-specific password you created above in a “New
 repository secret” named `EMAIL_PASSWORD`. Add your iCloud email address to a “New 
 repository secret” named `EMAIL_USERNAME`.

> If you use different secret names, you will need to modify the YAML file provided below
 to match.


### Part 3: Workflow file

1. Create a new file in your repository. As an example, the file is named` _build.yml` 
and will be stored in this path from the root of your project `.github/workflows`. If 
you don’t currently have those directories, you can enter the following command in your 
terminal:

```bash
mkdir -p .github/workflows
touch _build.yml
```
Using the `-p` flag, this will `m`a`k`e `dir`ectory or directories if they do not 
currently exist and create (touch) the new file. Alternatively, you can use the GUI tools 
if that’s easier.

2. Open `_build.yml` and paste in this content:

```yaml
name: Build

on:
  push:
    branches: main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Hello World
        run: echo Hello, world!

      - name: Send status email via iCloud
        if: always()
        uses: dawidd6/action-send-mail@v3
        with:
          server_address: smtp.mail.me.com
          server_port: 587  # iCloud SMTP requires TLS (STARTTLS)
          secure: false  # This must be false for STARTTLS to work
          username: ${{ secrets.EMAIL_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.EMAIL_PASSWORD }}
          subject: "${{ github.repository }} workflow: ${{ job.status }}"
          # github.job will be lowercase of the `name` value in line 1. Here, "build".
          # github.workflow will will match the `name` value in line 1
          # github.repository is the repository name: kyleGrealis/my-repo-name
          # job.status: "success" or "failure" 
          body:  |
            ${{ github.workflow }} of ${{ github.repository }}

            Job: ${{ github.job }}
            Status: ${{ job.status }}"
          to: "kylegrealis@proton.me"
          from: "From my GitHub Actions Bot"
```

Though this file may initially appear as overwhelming or complicated, it uses a 
relatively straight-forward `key:value` syntax:

* Name the workflow “Build”. This will appear under the “Actions” tab and then the left 
side of the screen for your GitHub repository.

![](/blog/posts/images/gh-actions-email/gh-3.png)

* The `on:` section states that this action will run on each project `push` on the `main` 
branch. To add other branches, move `main` to the next line with one more indent and a dash:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - dev
```

* The `jobs` section declares what is to happen and how it is to happen. The explanations 
are beyond the scope of this, so explore GitHub 
[documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) for more information.

* There will be two main jobs that will run:

1. Echo "Hello World" to the Actions console.

2. Send a status email

* The email with `always()` be sent, regardlesss if the job was a success or failure.

* Be sure not to alter the `server` or `secure` lines or risk unexpected consequences or 
workflow failure.

* The `username` and `password` are self-explanatory. The secret names you provided in 
Part 2 must match the names inside the braces (e.g., `secrets.EMAIL_USERNAME`) to 
correctly provide those values. This format prevents leaking your personal information 
to others, like the author is doing here.

* The `subject` and `body` can be modfied with whatever information you desire. Use 
`body: |` then indent to create a multiple line & custom structure to the email. A 
successful run will return this with your own information included:

* Save, commit, add a message, and push this file to your repository. You should quickly 
receive a status email if everything was done correctly. You can view the real-time 
workflow by navigating to the “Actions” tab in your repository, select the name of your 
action (i.e., “Build”), and select the commit message you gave. Using the image from 
above (and repeated here), the commit message was “updated”. Selecting that will give 
you an easy interface to select and check the logs. The logs provide a good amount of 
detail to help the debugging process if something went wrong.

## Conclusion

GitHub Actions can really enhance your data science workflow by offloading manual tasks 
to action-specific or chronological jobs. Integrating them is quite easy and only 
requires about 30 minutes of reading and testing before you will be able to adapt this 
simple example to meet your needs.
