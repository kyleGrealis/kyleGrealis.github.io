## The Azimuth Project

An azimuth is the angle of compass direction. An azimuth demands you know where you're going, you have intentional movement in your journey. My journey in creating the Azimuth Project is not one singular project. My career is the Azimuth Project. My direction is forward. Our paces may differ. Like entering into realms of uncharted territory, I cannot foresee how each step will feel or how sure-footed progress will be. I do anticipate setbacks, restarts, and -- yeah -- at times questioning if it's worth the effort.

Those feelings are natural and I am here to challenge myself and to be challenged. Here and now is where I plot my course, set my way-points, and shoot my azimuth. Here is where I document those steps.
