## Hey there! ðŸ‘‹  I'm Kyle Grealis...

I'm a Biostatistician and Lead Data Analyst at the University of Miami. After nearly 20 years as a respiratory therapist, I discovered data science and its potential to transform healthcare. The attention to detail that's essential in bedside care translates directly to data analysis.

I've worked with physicians and researchers in pulmonary medicine, and since COVID-19, I've transitioned to the Department of Public Health Sciences. Currently, we're developing machine learning algorithms to predict individual relapse in those affected by the opioid epidemic.

I'm passionate about open source software and have authored the {froggeR} and {nascaR.data} R packages, co-authored {rUM}, and contributed to {tidyREDCap} and other packages. This website showcases my R packages and web applications that streamline workflows and contribute to the community.

When I'm not analyzing data, you'll find me following track & field, running, or tinkering with Linux systems.
