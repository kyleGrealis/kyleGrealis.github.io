## Hey there! 👋  I'm Kyle Grealis...

I'm a Biostatistician and Lead Data Analyst at the University of Miami. I spent nearly 20 years as a respiratory therapist before discovering the world of data science and its importance on healthcare. Attention to detail is as critical a skill in bedside care as it is in data analysis. 

I've been fortunate to work with some great physicians and researchers in the field of pulmonary medicine, and I've recently transitioned to the Department of Public Health Sciences at the University of Miami. Currently, we are developing machine learning algorithms to predict individual relapse in those affected by the opioid epidemic.

I'm excited to help evolve the preventative side of healthcare after many years on what can be considered the responsive side. This website is a collection of my work, web applications that I've developed as teaching tools for epidemiology and biostatistics, and a blog where I share what I'm learning along the way. Let's come together to grow the fields of data science and healthcare.
