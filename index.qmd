## The Azimuth Project

An azimuth is the angle of compass direction. An azimuth demands you know where you're going, you have intentional movement in your journey. My journey in creating the Azimuth Project does not consist of one singular project. My career is the Azimuth Project. My direction is forward. Our pace may differ. Like entering into realms of uncharted territory, I cannot foresee how each step will feel or how sure-footed progress will be. I do anticipate setbacks, restarts, and -- yeah -- at times wanting to just go back as if I had never started.

 I just don't want to stay in this one place. I want to learn. I want to challenge myself and be challenged too. Here and now is where I plot my course, set my way-points, and shoot my azimuth. Here is where I take those first steps.
