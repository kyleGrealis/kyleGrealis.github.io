    "text": "Get the author’s unique ID\nThe first step that we’re going to do is obtain an author’s unique ID. This will allow us to be certain of the other results we are planning to obtain. You may search for an author and find out that there are multiple authors with the same name. Google Scholar provides each registered author with a unique ID, so we’ll grab and store that.\nThe httr2 package’s request function will allow us to make a request to the Serpapi API. We’ll use the req_url_query function to add the necessary parameters to the URL. We need to use the google_scholar_profiles search engine and enter my name into the mauthors field. The last argument is the secret key that we stored in the .env file. The req_perform() function will execute the request and store the response in the id_response object.\n\nid_response &lt;- request(url) |&gt;\n  req_url_query(\n    engine = \"google_scholar_profiles\",\n    mauthors = \"Kyle Grealis\",\n    # this will call on your secret key from the .env file\n    key = Sys.getenv(\"GOOGLE_KEY\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  req_perform()\n\nIf we take a few peeks at what is returned in the response object, we can see that the id_response object is a list of lists. The resp_body_json function will allow us to convert the response to a list of lists. The glimpse function will allow us to see the structure of the list of lists.\n\nid_response |&gt;\n  resp_body_json() |&gt;\n  glimpse()\n\nList of 3\n $ search_metadata  :List of 8\n  ..$ id                         : chr \"65ccfe6fdefa1308edb0e1dd\"\n  ..$ status                     : chr \"Success\"\n  ..$ json_endpoint              : chr \"https://serpapi.com/searches/0f89992b69d5b4f3/65ccfe6fdefa1308edb0e1dd.json\"\n  ..$ created_at                 : chr \"2024-02-14 17:54:55 UTC\"\n  ..$ processed_at               : chr \"2024-02-14 17:54:55 UTC\"\n  ..$ google_scholar_profiles_url: chr \"https://scholar.google.com/citations?mauthors=Kyle+Grealis&view_op=search_authors&hl=en\"\n  ..$ raw_html_file              : chr \"https://serpapi.com/searches/0f89992b69d5b4f3/65ccfe6fdefa1308edb0e1dd.html\"\n  ..$ total_time_taken           : num 0.92\n $ search_parameters:List of 3\n  ..$ engine  : chr \"google_scholar_profiles\"\n  ..$ mauthors: chr \"Kyle Grealis\"\n  ..$ hl      : chr \"en\"\n $ profiles         :List of 1\n  ..$ :List of 8\n  .. ..$ name        : chr \"Kyle Grealis\"\n  .. ..$ link        : chr \"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=sdB7YAkAAAAJ\"\n  .. ..$ serpapi_link: chr \"https://serpapi.com/search.json?author_id=sdB7YAkAAAAJ&engine=google_scholar_author&hl=en\"\n  .. ..$ author_id   : chr \"sdB7YAkAAAAJ\"\n  .. ..$ affiliations: chr \"University of Miami\"\n  .. ..$ email       : chr \"Verified email at miami.edu\"\n  .. ..$ cited_by    : NULL\n  .. ..$ thumbnail   : chr \"https://scholar.googleusercontent.com/citations?view_op=small_photo&user=sdB7YAkAAAAJ&citpid=1\"\n\n\nBut really– what is that mess? Well, it’s all of the information that is returned from the call to the API. We see that my name is listed in the ..$ mauthors: chr \"Kyle Grealis\" line and again in ..$ name       : chr \"Kyle Grealis\". Looking down a few more lines and we’ll see exactly what we’re looking for: the author_id. I can confirm that this is my profile because we also notice that my affiliation is listed as “University of Miami”. However, I’m sure you can see that if you find yourself, as mentioned above, searching for an author with a common name and are not familiar with their affiliations, you may have to do some more digging to find the correct author.\nWe can move on and use the pluck function to grab the author_id from the list and save it into an object of the same name. Later, I’m going to use this same technique to scrape information for the other members of my research team as I construct and update our team website.\n\nauthor_id &lt;- id_response |&gt;\n  resp_body_json() |&gt;\n  pluck(\"profiles\", 1, \"author_id\")\n\nauthor_id\n\n[1] \"sdB7YAkAAAAJ\"\n\n\nAnd, see… it’s a match to the author_id that we saw in the glimpse output. Now that we have the author_id, we can use it in the second part to obtain the author’s publications and information."
